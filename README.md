Brief Python SciPy NumPy Matplotlib codes related to neutrino physics
Please see the pdf document, which really gives a better idea of what the code here is intended to do.
In a nutshell, if you are a physics student who has gotten the usual text descriptions of the MSW effect
and the impact on the survival of solar electron neutrinos, but find the theoretical equations a bit
remote, the code we put up here shows you how to calculate and graph the survival probability for solar
neutrinos with MSW matter effect, how to derive the mass split and mix angle in matter (the eigenvalues
of the matter Hamiltonian) and why the standard oscillation formula does not work if you add the MSW effect,
despite some educational institutions offering that as appropriate. We provide links to more of our work and
additional documentation in the pdf doc to accompany the MSW scan code.
